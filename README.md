# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

This project focuses on building a **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis** model that leverages **text**, **image**, and potentially **audio** data to predict sentiment with higher accuracy than unimodal systems. The project uses **Transformer-based architectures** and is part of a six-week winter project organized by the **Google Developers Group (GDG) at IIT Kanpur**.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a deep learning model that integrates multiple modalities — such as **textual**, **visual**, and possibly **audio** data — for more accurate sentiment prediction.
